COVID-19 - 2019-nCoV - Searching and Scraping PubMed Journal Articles

The code Jupyter notebook does a search on PubMed using the following search strategy:

"COVID-19" [Supplementary Concept] OR 2019-nCoV OR COVID-19 OR SARS-CoV-2 OR coronavirus

Which is equivalent to the following URL:

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=%22COVID-19%22+%5BSupplementary+Concept%5D+OR+2019-nCoV+OR+COVID-19+OR+SARS-CoV-2+OR+coronavirus

Then, it scraps the information of the results and outputs a MS Excel file with the results.
